Run a factor_analysis using prices and shares issuance of international equities

Share issuance effect had shown a strong and significant effect on future stock returns, theories support manager's intent to profit from overpriced situation by issuing shares to the market and from underpriced situations by buying back shares. (Pontiff 2007)

In this project I tried to explore whether this relationship was still present when taking account for market friction costs and factor exposure.
